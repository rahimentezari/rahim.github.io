<h2>AutiGaze- An application for Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
  I've been always thinking about using machine learning for medical purposes. Fortunately, my wife is studing occupational therapy and so I am somehow familiar with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD).<p> 
Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder,first described in 1943 by Leo Kanner, chracterized by a triad of impiarments:<p>
  - social comppunication problems<p>
  - difficulties with reciprocal social interactions<p>
  - unusual patterns of repetetive behavior<p>
<h3>Did you know that?</h3>

These facts motivates me to know more about ASD, especially the current situation in Iran:<p>
