<h2>AutiGaze- An application for Autism Spectrum Disorder</h2>
  I've been always thinking about using machine learning for medical purposes. Fortunately, my wife is studing occupational therapy and so I am somehow familiar with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD).<p> 
Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder,first described in 1943 by Leo Kanner, chracterized by a triad of impiarments:<p>
  - social comppunication problems<p>
  - difficulties with reciprocal social interactions<p>
  - unusual patterns of repetetive behavior<p>
<h3>Did you know that?</h3>

These facts motivates me to know more about ASD, especially the current situation in Iran:<p>

So, my wife and I decided to design a smartphone application, AutiGaze, which will be used by children with autism. This application help them to improve their social behaviors.<p>
<h2>why is this a good solution?</h2>
  - Easily accessible for almost evetyone, instead of looking for doctors and visiting occupational therapists.<p>
  - The striking role of smartphone in people's life specially in Iran.<p>
  - Children with ASD like to play with digital devices and there is no need to force them.<p>
  - It can be used any moment,any place.<p>
  - lowering the cost in the phase of rehabilitaion.<p>
  - Pervasive usage helps screening in large scale.<p>
  - It can be fine-tuned for othe disorders like ADHD.<p>
In the figure below, you can see the overall capability of AutiGaze. <p>

</h2>Is it a good Idea?</h2>
We have asked some expert in the filed of computer science, marketing and neuroscience whether this Idea is a good one. The following is their feedback:<p>
