<h2>What is Gaze Estimation?</h2>

<p>The most important ways of non-verbal communication consist of facial expressions, hands position, gestures, and gaze. The last one plays a crucial role when people interact, as it is used to regulate the ﬂow of communication, monitor feedback, reﬂect cognitive activity, express emotions, and communicate the nature of the interpersonal relationship .In general, gaze is a very strong indicator for subject attention process.<p>
Gaze estimation methods can be model-based or appearance-based [1]. Model-based methods use a geometric eye model and can be further divided into cornealreflection and shape-based methods, depending on whether they require external light sources to detect eye features.
Early works on corneal reflection-based methods focused on stationary settings and were later extended to handle arbitrary head poses using multiple light sources or cameras. <p>
In contrast, shape-based methods directly infer gaze directions from observed eye shapes, such as pupil centre or iris edges. Although they have recently been applied to more practical application scenarios , their accuracy is lower and it is unclear whether shape-based approaches can robustly handle low image quality and variable lighting conditions. <p>
Appearance-based gaze estimation methods directly use eye images as input and can therefore potentially work with low-resolution eye images.[2] Appearance-based gaze estimation which does not need specific tools is a hot topic research in computer vision as it can be used for several application domains, including gaze-based human-computer interaction and visual behavior analysis. <p>
