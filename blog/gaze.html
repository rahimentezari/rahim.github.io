<h2>What is Gaze Estimation?</h2>

<p>The most important ways of non-verbal communication consist of facial expressions, hands position, gestures, and gaze. The last one plays a crucial role when people interact, as it is used to regulate the ﬂow of communication, monitor feedback, reﬂect cognitive activity, express emotions, and communicate the nature of the interpersonal relationship[1] .In general, gaze is a very strong indicator for subject attention process.
In the recent years, as there is much rich information in non-verbal cues, there has been a growing interest from diverse domain on tools, which are able to retrieve the state of human.
Appearance-based gaze estimation which does not need specific tools is a hot topic research in computer vision as it can be used for several application domains, including gaze-based human-computer interaction and visual behavior analysis[2]. 
We now know that the desired gaze consists of two factors [3] i.e. the head pose and the eye locations. The estimation of these mentioned factors is often achieved using expensive or limiting hardware.Therefore, the problem is often simpliﬁed by either considering the head pose or the eye center locations as the only feature to understand the interest of a subject[4]<p>
