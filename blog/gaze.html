<h2>What is Gaze Estimation?</h2>

<p>The most important ways of non-verbal communication consist of facial expressions, hands position, gestures, and gaze. The last one plays a crucial role when people interact, as it is used to regulate the ﬂow of communication, monitor feedback, reﬂect cognitive activity, express emotions, and communicate the nature of the interpersonal relationship .In general, gaze is a very strong indicator for subject attention process.<p>
Gaze estimation methods can be model-based or appearance-based [1]. Model-based methods use a geometric eye model and can be further divided into cornealreflection and shape-based methods, depending on whether they require external light sources to detect eye features. Early works on corneal reflection-based methods focused on stationary settings and were later extended to handle arbitrary head poses using multiple light sources or cameras. <p>
In contrast, shape-based methods directly infer gaze directions from observed eye shapes, such as pupil centre or iris edges. Although they have recently been applied to more practical application scenarios , their accuracy is lower and it is unclear whether shape-based approaches can robustly handle low image quality and variable lighting conditions. <p>
Appearance-based gaze estimation methods directly use eye images as input and can therefore potentially work with low-resolution eye images.[2] Appearance-based gaze estimation which does not need specific tools is a hot topic research in computer vision as it can be used for several application domains, including gaze-based human-computer interaction and visual behavior analysis. <p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
Two years ago, when my superviser,  <a href="http://mahfathy.iust.ac.ir/index.php/en/"> Prof. Dr. Mahmood Fathy</a>  suggested me to work on gaze estimation, I started to search for applications of this computer vision task. I got suprized as I found there are lots of applications for gaze estimation. Here comes some of these :<p>
	- Neuro-Marketing<p>

	Human Gaze Estimation can be used for the following tasks:<p>
	+ Product design: designing is a crucial phase.Irrespective of the quality, if the product has not been properly designed, the customer would not buy it. The designer can use gaze estimation methods to have better designing/packaging. <p>
	+ Advertising: The main objective of advertising is to attract the user/customer attraction.We can use gaze estimation methods to check the quality of designed video-clip/poster, in terms of attraction. <p>
	+ Online experiences: A web developer can use gaze estimation to design more attractive web pages.<p>
	+ Shopper decision making : We can use gaze estimation methods to put the products in the shelves,properly.<p>

	- Rehabilitaion<p>
	We can use gaze estimation as assistive thechnology,e.g. gaze-controlled monitors to help people with ALS. Some disorder such as ADHD and ASD, are closly related to attention problems. Gaze estimation methods can be used not only for the diagnose of such disorders but also for rehabilitaion. <a href="https://rahimentezari.github.io/blog/autigaze.html"> Here </a> is an example 
	- Sports<p>
	- Psychology<p>
	- Driver-assistance<p>
